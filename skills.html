      Throughout my academic career and practical projects, I have acquired a diverse skill set that allows me to approach problems from multiple angles. Here are the core technical and analytical skills I bring to the table:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> My experience in machine learning is extensive. I have implemented various ML models that are used to make predictions and solve complex problems. I am proficient in algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, SVMs, and neural networks. My work includes both supervised and unsupervised learning projects, leveraging Python libraries like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.</li>

      <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Data drives decisions in today’s world. I am well-versed in the techniques needed to analyze data, extract patterns, and deliver meaningful insights. Using tools such as Python, SQL, and Power BI, I’ve performed data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization to uncover trends and inform strategy.</li>

      <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> I have strong programming skills in Python and C, which I’ve used to develop both back-end and front-end applications. These languages form the backbone of my problem-solving ability, allowing me to write efficient and optimized code.</li>

      <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> As a full-stack developer, I am proficient in building dynamic, responsive websites. My web development skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as ReactJS and Flask. I have worked on creating both client-side and server-side applications, integrating them to offer smooth user experiences.</li>

      <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Data is the foundation of many modern applications, and I am skilled in managing both SQL and NoSQL databases, particularly MongoDB and MySQL. My database management skills ensure that applications are backed by scalable, efficient, and secure data storage solutions.</li>

      <li><strong>Cloud Computing:</strong> I am familiar with deploying applications on cloud platforms like AWS. With knowledge of cloud infrastructure, I can ensure applications are scalable, resilient, and secure in a production environment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      This unique combination of skills enables me to work across different domains of technology, from building intuitive front-end interfaces to developing robust back-end systems and performing deep data analysis.
