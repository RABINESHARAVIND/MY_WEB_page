  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>
      The best way to demonstrate skills is through real-world projects, and I’ve had the opportunity to work on several that challenged my technical abilities and pushed me to grow. Here’s a closer look at some of the key projects I’ve completed:

  <h3>1. Image Captions Generator</h3>
  <p>
      This project is one of my proudest accomplishments. The goal was to build an AI-based system that generates accurate captions for images by identifying objects, actions, and scenes in the picture. Using LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks) in conjunction with pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), I developed a model that processes visual data and outputs descriptive text. The model was built using PyTorch, and the system includes a user-friendly web interface that allows users to upload images and receive captions. This project taught me a lot about deep learning, image processing, and working with neural networks.

  <h3>2. Early Detection of Diabetes and Risk Assessment</h3>
  <p>
      In this project, I focused on leveraging machine learning to build a tool that could predict an individual's risk of developing diabetes. Using a dataset of 800 patients (500 non-diabetic and 300 diabetic), I implemented and compared two models—SVM (with an accuracy of 77.2%) and Logistic Regression (with an accuracy of 75.2%). The aim of this project was to create a user-friendly system that provides early detection of diabetes risk, which could be helpful for healthcare providers and patients alike. This project sharpened my skills in model evaluation, data preprocessing, and the interpretation of results.

  <h3>3. Full-Stack Portfolio Website</h3>
  <p>
      To consolidate my web development skills, I built this portfolio website from scratch. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS for the front-end, and Flask for the back-end, I created a fully responsive and interactive portfolio. The site serves as a showcase for my projects and skills, and it was an excellent learning experience in front-end design, back-end development, and deployment.

      These projects reflect not only my technical capabilities but also my problem-solving mindset, creativity, and commitment to delivering high-quality work. I’m always on the lookout for new projects that push the boundaries of what I know, and I’m excited to tackle future challenges.
